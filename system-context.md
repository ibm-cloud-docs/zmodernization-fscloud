# System context
{: #system-context}

A custom image is created from the on-premises zSystem to deploy into WaaS on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using the Wazi Image Builder tool.
{: shortdesc}

The custom image is stored in the IBM Cloud Object Storage service. The WaaS instance is created from a custom image that is stored in Cloud Object Storage. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services like Wazi as a Service, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, Key Protect / HPCS, Cloud Object Storage, and Security and Compliance Center are all provisioned through an industry standard framework automation that is secure and financial services compliant. Developers and Testers work in a closed and segregated hybrid environment not allowing any public internet. A DevOps toolchain and deployable architecture are provided to create the whole solution in an on-demand basis.
