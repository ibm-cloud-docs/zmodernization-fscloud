# Introduction
{: #intro}

Many organizations face significant challenges when it comes to integrating their core systems, including Mainframe applications, with modern technologies. This integration is crucial for modernizing core enterprise applications on hybrid cloud platforms. Shockingly, a staggering 33% of developers lack the necessary skills or resources, hindering their productivity in delivering products and services. Moreover, 36% of developers struggle with the collaboration between development and IT Operations, leading to inefficiencies in the development pipeline. To compound these issues, repeated surveys highlight “testing” as the primary area causing delays in project timelines. Companies are taking steps to standardize development tools and approaches across their platforms to overcome these challenges and drive transformation in their business processes.

Regulated industries support their core business transactions with time-tested qualities of service (QoS) like security, resiliency, and high availability. As evolving new business models require modernization of these core monolithic workloads, enterprises are looking for a hybrid cloud platform with strong security and compliance feature support to achieve this. {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is designed for regulatory workloads and works with an ecosystem of regulated clients and ISVs to continuously improve the compliance posture. IBM Cloud has many features to support Hybrid Cloud deployments and is uniquely positioned to support enterprise workloads including regulated workloads with its support for heterogeneous compute architectures like x86, Z and Power. IBM Cloud also benefits immensely from IBM Z platform centric enterprise cloud services like [Wazi as a Service (WaaS)](./zmodernization-fscloud?topic=zmodernization-fscloud-wazi-intro.md) offered in its catalog.

## Proof of concept
{: #poc}

This white paper pattern introduces a proof of concept to modernize mainframe applications and integrate on-premises enterprise environment with [IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about#ibm-cloud-framework-for-financial-services) for development, testing and onboarding. The POC provides an on-demand basis environment through secure DevSecOps automation. The POC showcases some of the patterns to modernize mainframe applications and end-to-end industry solutions.

Expanding the data centers and migrating the applications for multiple environments takes tremendous resources and a slower process to deliver solutions. The POC showcase how to overcome the problems by enabling the environments on-demand and through automation and helping to modernize the application at speed and with ease.
