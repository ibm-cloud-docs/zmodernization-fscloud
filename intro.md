# Introduction
{: #intro}

This white paper introduces a proof of concept with patterns to modernize mainframe applications and integrate on-premises enterprise environments with [IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about#ibm-cloud-framework-for-financial-services) for development, testing and onboarding. The POC provides on-demand basis environments through secure DevSecOps automation. The POC showcases some of the patterns to modernize mainframe applications with end-to-end industry solutions.

Expanding data centers and migrating applications to multiple environments can take tremendous resources and time to deliver solutions. This POC showcases how to overcome some of these problems by enabling the environments on-demand and through automation and helping to modernize applications at speed and with ease.
