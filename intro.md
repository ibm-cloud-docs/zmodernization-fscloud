{: #intro}

This white paper pattern introduces a proof of concept to modernize mainframe applications and integrate on-premises enterprise environment with [IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-about#ibm-cloud-framework-for-financial-services) for development, testing and onboarding. The POC provides an on-demand basis environment through secure DevSecOps automation. The POC showcases some of the patterns to modernize mainframe applications and end-to-end industry solutions.

Expanding the data centers and migrating the applications for multiple environments takes tremendous resources and a slower process to deliver solutions. The POC showcase how to overcome the problems by enabling the environments on-demand and through automation and helping to modernize the application at speed and with ease.
